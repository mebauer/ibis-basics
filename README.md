# Ibis Basics
Author: Mark Bauer

# 1. Introduction

This tutorial was inspired by my recent but intense interest in composable SQL and Python dataframe code, and of course, Ibis. Learning how well DuckDB integrates with Ibis was even more of a reason to delve deeper into this portable Python dataframe library. And lastly, anything that Wes McKinney is passionate about is probably worth learning.

Tutorials from Ibis contributors served as great starting points. Much of what I know about Ibis either came from the [offical docs](https://ibis-project.org/) or these tutorials:
- Official Docs Tutorial: getting started: https://ibis-project.org/tutorials/getting_started
- Ibis Tutorial PyCon 2024: https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-tutorial
- A repository of runnable examples using ibis: https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-examples
